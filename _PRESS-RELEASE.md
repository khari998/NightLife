There is an approach called "working backwards" that is widely used at Amazon. They work backwards from the customer, rather than starting with an idea for a product and trying to bolt customers onto it. While working backwards can be applied to any specific product decision, using this approach is especially important when developing new products or features.

For new initiatives a product manager typically starts by writing an internal press release announcing the finished product. The target audience for the press release is the new/updated product's customers, which can be retail customers or internal users of a tool or technology. Internal press releases are centered around the customer problem, how current solutions (internal or external) fail, and how the new product will blow away existing solutions.

If the benefits listed don't sound very interesting or exciting to customers, then perhaps they're not (and shouldn't be built). Instead, the product manager should keep iterating on the press release until they've come up with benefits that actually sound like benefits. Iterating on a press release is a lot less expensive than iterating on the product itself (and quicker!).

If the press release is more than a page and a half, it is probably too long. Keep it simple. 3-4 sentences for most paragraphs. Cut out the fat. Don't make it into a spec. You can accompany the press release with a FAQ that answers all of the other business or execution questions so the press release can stay focused on what the customer gets. My rule of thumb is that if the press release is hard to write, then the product is probably going to suck. Keep working at it until the outline for each paragraph flows.

Oh, and I also like to write press-releases in what I call "Oprah-speak" for mainstream consumer products. Imagine you're sitting on Oprah's couch and have just explained the product to her, and then you listen as she explains it to her audience. That's "Oprah-speak", not "Geek-speak".

Once the project moves into development, the press release can be used as a touchstone; a guiding light. The product team can ask themselves, "Are we building what is in the press release?" If they find they're spending time building things that aren't in the press release (overbuilding), they need to ask themselves why. This keeps product development focused on achieving the customer benefits and not building extraneous stuff that takes longer to build, takes resources to maintain, and doesn't provide real customer benefit (at least not enough to warrant inclusion in the press release).

## Heading
  > NiteLyfe (working title)

## Sub-Heading
  > An app for people looking for hot nightlife spots around their current location.

## Summary
  > Our product has a heat map with live comment streams for bars and clubs. We also give a recommendation based on past visits and reviews. Lastly, users can add emergency guardians and share their location with them with one click.

## Problem
  > Our product helps users who want an active night life find locations that are currently active. Users will no longer have to hope the establishment they choose to visit for a night will have  fun and active environment. Instead, users can see population density and real time comments for locations they wish to go to.

## Solution
  > Our product's heat map shows current users who are at a specific location. Users can add a comment for a location they are currently at, and those comments will be visible for a short time to all users who are logged in. Users will also get recommendations for places to go based on past user inputs.

## Quote from You
  > Our product takes the guessing out of a night out.

## How to Get Started
  > Download the app, sign in with google, and see hot spots in your area.

## Customer Quote
  > "NyteLyfe changes the game in going out. I want to go to active places with good music, and the live comments and heat map give me this option."
